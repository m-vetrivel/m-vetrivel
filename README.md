### Hi there, I'm Vetrivel M ðŸ‘‹

I'm a final-year Computer Science student with a passion for building applications that solve real-world problems. [cite_start]My journey into development has been driven by turning complex challenges into clean, user-friendly solutions, from AI-powered coding mentors to data-driven mobile apps[cite: 302, 298]. I'm particularly excited about leveraging AI to create more intuitive and helpful user experiences.

I am actively seeking a full-time **Software Development Engineer** or **Full-Stack Developer** role where I can contribute to a creative team and make a meaningful impact. Feel free to reach out if you think I'd be a good fit!
